                    Due to the rise in the usage of internet applications, the concern over data security has been
questioned. To secure the information over the communication channel cryptography is used.
There are various cryptographic algorithms used for the encryption and decryption of the data
one such algorithm is an Advanced Encryption Standard. In our project, we have designed an
Advanced Encryption Standard of key size 128bits using Cipher block chaining (CBC) mode. We
have used Spartan-VI family device XC6SLX4-CSG225(device package) in Xilinx 14.7 version.
This mode makes use of an initialization vector IV which is an important part of this algorithm.
Advanced encryption standard is a block cipher-based symmetric-key cryptography that operates
on a 128-bit block of input data. The key size we have used for the encryption and decryption
is 128 bits. For a key size of 128 bits, 10 rounds are performed on an input block of data.
The advanced encryption standard algorithm uses a round function to perform four different
byte-oriented transformations that are Sub Byte: for byte substitution using S-box, Shift Rows:
Shifting rows of the state array, Mix Columns: Mixing the data within each column, Add
Round Key: for adding the round key to the state. The Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) uses
an initialization vector- IV and makes use of a block cipher algorithm. As the plain text that
is being sent in the real world is of varying lengths it is divided into blocks and needs to add
padding data of 128 bits before encryption or decryption. The plaintext block is then Xor ’ed
with the initialization vector IV. Using a block cipher algorithm, it is converted to cipher block
text. Encryption result is used to xor with the plaintext block until the last block. When
it comes to decrypting the data, it can be decrypted in parallel which is not possible when
encrypting the data block. On analyzing the results, it takes 256 clock cycles to shift the plain
text and cipher text serially out. The effect of implementing PISO on IO ports reduces the
requirement from 642 – 305% to 5 – 2.3%
